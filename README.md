## My MovieApp React Project

This is a very basic movie finder app with the main page being the search bar which allows you to search movies from the imdb api

Upon making a search for a movie, a list of movies will show up beneath the search bar, on hover, there is an add button with a few bugs at the moment but it allows you to add that particular movie to your favorites.

### Favorites

In the favorites page, it shows the poster and the title of the moviee/movies that you added when you clicked on the button, right now there is no function to remove movies from the favorites which is unfortunate but the movies are stored in local state so if you rerender the page, the movies will still remain in the favorites.

useReducer and Context API were used in the functionality of adding the movies to the favorites .
